Welcome to my Website!

I will post light-hearted writing about my projects quite frequently here, in topics ranging from standard theoretical statistics topics to fun thought experiments.

Much of the photography in the website will be from Unsplash, but I will also occasionally post my own photos as well!

Hope you have a great year. Cheers!
-Victor
