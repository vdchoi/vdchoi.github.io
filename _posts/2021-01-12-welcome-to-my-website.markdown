When reading statistics papers and blogs, I often feel intimidated by the complexity of the writing. For this website, I hope to put a more light-hearted spin on statistics, by joining classical statistics with some creative writing in my posts. I plan to write on topics ranging from photography to thought experiments, and incorporate some interesting statistical concepts in the process. 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or would like to discuss ideas together!

Much of the photography in the website will be from Unsplash, but I will also occasionally post my own photos as well.

Hope you have a great year. Cheers!
