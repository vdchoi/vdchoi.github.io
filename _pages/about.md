I work as a Senior Product Analyst at TrueCar, responsible for product analytics and experimentation on our Marketplace and Growth product teams. 
I enjoy reading about new experimentation approaches, applied machine learning problems, and business strategy. If you have any good receommendations for these topics, please let me know!

Aside from work, I love to cook, read, and travel. I'll post some of favorites around my website.

Always happy to chat, or receive feedback on my writing. Feel free to shoot me an email!
